# demos-https://github.com/aldencabajar/demos-/blob/master/README.md
This is just a compilation of all the scripting projects that I have done in R. 
All scripts done are to showcase my works in all activtities involving data science and statistics. 

## delloitessurveyproc.R 
is a script that I have developed to collate, extract and process survey data from xlsx files.

## gridworld.R
is a code implementing a Q-learning Reinforcement learning algorithm where an intelligent agent (a robot perhaps) was made to solve a grid-world maze. Turns out he did well. 

## titanic.survival.R
is a script that I implemented in the feature engineering and predictive modelling of the titanic survival dataset from kaggle. Used Support vector machines to classify passengers if they survived or not. 

## rsm-spraydrying.R
was my attempt in scripting an automated data processing and visualization script for the experiment results of the spray drying of mango kernel extracts into neutraceuticals. Here I have developed a predictive response surface model w/ graphs and implemented a code on the multiresponse optimization using desirability function approach.
